/*
 * This is meant to be used in conjunction with __in_section() and similar
 * where scattered structure instances are concatened together by the linker
 * and walked by the code at run time just like a contiguous array of such
 * structures.
 *
 * Assemblers and linkers may insert alignment padding by default whose
 * size is larger than the natural alignment for those structures when
 * gathering various section segments together, messing up the array walk.
 * To prevent this, we need to provide an explicit alignment not to rely
 * on the default that might just work by luck.
 *
 * Alignment statements in  linker scripts are not sufficient as
 * the assembler may add padding by itself to each segment when switching
 * between sections within the same file even if it merges many such segments
 * into a single section in the end.
